# Bank-Churn-Analysis-
# 🔍 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a comprehensive end-to-end implementation of a **customer churn prediction system** for the banking sector. It combines **statistical analysis**, **machine learning**, and **Power BI visualizations** to both predict churn and explain the underlying reasons driving customer attrition.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Identify which bank customers are likely to churn.
- Understand key factors contributing to churn using statistical techniques.
- Build predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
- Visualize churn patterns in Power BI to communicate results effectively to stakeholders.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

### 🧪 Statistical Analysis
- **Welch’s T-Test**: Identify numerical features with significantly different means between churned and retained customers.
- **Chi-Square Test**: Test dependence between categorical features and churn.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Explore linear relationships.

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear model for baseline prediction.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble model for handling complex interactions.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Classifier for high-dimensional spaces.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.

### 📊 Power BI Visualization
- Unpivoted churn distribution across demographics (gender, geography, credit card, active membership).
- 100% stacked bar charts and clustered visuals to aid interpretation.
